        <h4>The Project</h4>
        <p>
          QQUAD CAPTCHA is an (open source) gamified bot detector web
          application. The project aims to create a light-weight MVP to reach
          early customers and show potential companies how the app can be a
          game-changer in the fraud prevention industry.

        <h4>Applying for YC2020</h4>
        <p>
          Despite the fact that the website was far from even good, I tried to
          give it a shot and apply it to YC2020. And the outcome was a
          rejection.
        </p>
        <p>
          YC (Y Combinator) is a VC (Venture Capital) firm and accelerator based
          in the US, they help companies grow from just an idea to become a
          potential hyper-growth startup, through investing money and provining
          remarkable business and marketing insights to the founders.
        </p>

        <h4>Testing with Companies</h4>
        <p>
          After the project has been turned down from YC, I tried to test the
          idea with fraud prevention companies, I looked for a tiny window of
          interest as positive feedback so that I can continue with the project
          without been worry about being in the wrong direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Target was Cloudflare. I reached out to Mr. Mathew Prince
          (CEO of Cloudflare), I discussed the idea with him, and thankfully
          after he interacted with the app, he told me, "I found it really tough
          to understand what to do when I tried it."
        </p>
        <p>
          A usability issue, that is what the feedback suggests. Then I realized
          the problem is with the user onboarding, it's kinda hard to teach
          users how to solve the CAPTCHA
        </p>

        <h4>What is next?</h4>
        <p>
          My job for the next iteration is to solve this problem and conduct a
          usability test with real users, then going for the next level, which
          is shipping.
        </p>

        <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
        <p>
          The initial idea may work very well and solve a real-world problem,
          but not exactly as you planned, so you have to be open to any
          structural change that needs toward the perfection of the product
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing early is the best action to take if you want to find out
          whether your design decisions are right or wrong. This way, you wonâ€™t
          waste a lot of energy and time(money) going in the wrong direction.
